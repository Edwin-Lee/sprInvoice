### Usage
Simepl edit the content as needed for your invoice. There are 3 main classes that can be applied to #invoice, "paid", "unpaid", and "new". 

"New" styles the invoice without any special coloring, "paid" adds green accents and a "Paid in full" notice, and "unpaid" (useful for overdue invoices) adds red accents.

A template example exists for all three cases.
